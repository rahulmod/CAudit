Rather than a credit score or credit history which tracks how reliable borrowers are, we will generate a score of how profitable a loan will be compared to other loans in the past. The combination of credit scores, credit history, and profitability score will help increase the bottom line for financial institution.\n\nHaving a interporable model that an loan officer can use before performing a full underwriting can provide immediate estimate and response for the borrower and a informative view for the lender.\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/cuQYr6\"><img src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jNxPym/Image.png\" alt=\"Image\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nThis notebook is dependent on the original Loan Risk Analysis Python notebook and executes its binary classifier using XGBoost.\n\n* Use the Databricks Runtime 4.1 or 4.2 ML Beta where XGBoost is automatically installed\n* Note, to run the `CrossValidator()`, please use 4.2 ML Beta or higher where Spark 2.3.1 now treats the Pipeline as an Estimator, wrapping it in a CrossValidator instance \n* To install XGBoost on an existing cluster, refer to [Databricks Documentation >
